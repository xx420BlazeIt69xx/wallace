# t6040 device tree fill-in checklist

## STATUS: draft CREATED + dtc-valid (2026-07-10)

Files written in `~/code/linux/arch/arm64/boot/dts/apple/` (on branch
`feature/m4-m5-minimal-device-trees` — the `t6040-minimal-device-trees` branch was
never actually created; files are uncommitted there):
- `t6040.dtsi` (SoC: 4E+5P+5P cpus, AIC, pmgr×4, wdt, serial0, timer, clkref)
- `t6040-j614s.dts` (board: compatible/model, framebuffer, memory, serial enable)
- `t6040-pmgr.dtsi` (214 power-controllers, generated from j614s.adt)
- Makefile: `t6040-j614s.dtb` added.

**Builds clean** via `clang -E … | dtc` → 46 KB DTB, 14 cpus + 214 pwrstates.
(Kernel `make dtbs` needs GNU make ≥4.0 + cross-gcc, absent on this M1 host — used
standalone dtc.) **All items 1–7 below RESOLVED with live-ADT values** (blob saved
at `~/code/linux/j614s.adt`, 606 KB, iBoot per boot-log). Remaining: **item 8
(boot test)** — needs a Linux build env + the actual boot attempt.

Resolved values: AIC `0x5_02400000` (event +0x40000; NOT the old t6050 guess
`0x2_80400000`), UART `0x4_29200000` IRQ **1559**, WDT `0x5_0836c000` IRQ **827**,
mem base `0x100_00000000`, cpus 0x0-3 (E, l2 4M) / 0x10100-4 + 0x10200-4 (P, l2
16M), pmgr ×4 (0x2_88e80000, 0x5_02280000, 0x5_02800000, 0x5_08300000).

## Item 8 (boot test) — ATTEMPTED 2026-07-10, reached kboot handoff

Kernel builds + boots via m1n1 through the ENTIRE `kboot_prepare_dt` and most of
`kboot_boot`. Validated on HW: CPU-map (after the slot-9 `cpu@10105` placeholder
fix), MCC SLC enable, PCIe t6040 parse (7 regs/port). **Blocked**: an imprecise
async **L2C access-fault SError** (`L2C_ERR_STS 0x82`, `ADR 0x283640500578190`)
in the final kboot steps (after `dapf`), before the kernel jump — Linux hasn't run
yet. mcc/usb ruled out; carveout/SLC interaction is the top suspect. Full analysis
+ next steps: `2026-07-10-t6040-stagec-boot-session.md`. NO t6050-style
VM_TMR_FIQ_ENA AIC crash (the risk item 8.3 flagged) — different failure.

--- original checklist (proxy commands per item) below ---

Draft DTs live in `~/code/linux` branch `t6040-minimal-device-trees`
(`t6040.dtsi`, `t6040-j614s.dts`, on top of yuka's `feature/m4-m5-minimal-device-trees`).
Every unverified value is tagged `TODO(adt)` — grep for it. This doc maps each
one to the proxy command that resolves it. All of it needs one session with the
proxy up (`shell.py` on the host).

## 0. One-time: dump the ADT

```py
# in proxyclient/tools/shell.py
open("j614s.adt", "wb").write(u.get_adt())
```

Keep this blob forever — it answers every question below offline, and it's the
input to the pmgr generator. (Note: yuka's t8132/t6050 commits used macOS
26.6b2 firmware; note our iBoot version alongside the dump.)

## 1. CPU topology + reg values → t6040.dtsi cpus/cpu-map

```py
for node in u.adt["/cpus"]:
    print(node.name, hex(node.reg), node.cluster_type, node.die_cluster_id)
```

Fix: number of clusters (draft assumes 4E + 5P + 5P), each cpu node's `reg`
(draft uses t602x-style 0x0/0x10100/0x10200 bases), compatibles (expect
`apple,sawtooth` E / `apple,everest` P per earlier ioreg check).

## 2. L2 cache sizes → l2_cache_0/1/2

```py
u.adt["/cpus/cpu0"].l2_cache_size   # and one core per cluster
```

## 3. AIC base → aic node (CRITICAL — currently a t6050 guess)

```py
node = u.adt["/arm-io/aic"]
print(node.get_reg(0))   # base+size; add arm-io base 0x2_00000000 if reg is relative
```

Draft guesses `0x2_80400000` (copied from t6050). Also verify the second reg
(event/IACK page) against what the t8122-aic3 binding expects; m1n1's
`src/aic.c` shows how the offsets are derived.

## 4. UART IRQ → serial0 interrupts

```py
u.adt["/arm-io/uart0"].interrupts
```

reg `0x4_29200000` is already verified. Draft carries t8132's IRQ 1046 as a
placeholder. After fixing: flip `&serial0` to `status = "okay"` in the .dts.

## 5. Watchdog → add wdt node (currently omitted)

```py
node = u.adt["/arm-io/wdt"]
print(node.get_reg(0), node.interrupts)
```

Copy the t8132 wdt node shape with these values.

## 6. pmgr → generate t6040-pmgr.dtsi

```sh
python proxyclient/tools/pmgr_adt2dt.py j614s.adt > t6040-pmgr.dtsi
```

Then: add the two pmgr nodes to t6040.dtsi (t8132 shape, reg from
`/arm-io/pmgr` `get_reg(0)`/`get_reg(1)`), `#include "t6040-pmgr.dtsi"` at the
bottom, and wire `power-domains` back into serial0 (`ps_uart0`) and
framebuffer0 (`ps_disp_cpu`/`ps_dptx_phy` — check names in the generated file;
the j614s fb is on dispext/dcp, verify which domain).

## 7. Memory base → j614s.dts memory node

```py
print(hex(u.ba.mem_base), hex(u.ba.mem_size))
```

Draft assumes `0x100_00000000` (t600x/t602x Pro-die convention; t8132 uses
0x8_00000000). m1n1 rewrites the reg anyway, but the unit address should match.

## 8. Boot test order

1. m1n1 with the broken_wfi patch (already on fork main) via chainload
2. Kernel: yuka's branch + our DTs, `CONFIG_ARCH_APPLE`, boot args `idle=nop`
   (per yuka's cover letter: wfi/wfit lose state on secondaries) — expect
   single-core first (`maxcpus=1`), console on DockChannel (kisd) or fb
3. Expect the t6050-style `SYS_IMP_APL_VM_TMR_FIQ_ENA_EL2` crash risk in AIC
   init — t8132 doesn't hit it, t6050 does; unknown which way t6040 goes.
   If it hits: patch out the write like yuka did, report which way it went.
4. Report to yuka (cyberchaos.dev/yuka/linux) / #asahi-dev either way — t6040
   fills the hole between her t8132 and t6050 series.

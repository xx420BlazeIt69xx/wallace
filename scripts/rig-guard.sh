#!/usr/bin/env bash
# rig-guard.sh — sourced by every rig-touching script so the lease is binding,
# not honor-system: two agents can never drive the one physical cable at once.
#
# SAFETY MODEL — block real collisions and hold identified agents to
# acquire-first, without ever blocking a human's manual run on an idle rig.
#   * If a LIVE lease is held by someone OTHER than you, REFUSE (exit 5) —
#     always, regardless of RIG_ENFORCE. This is the only situation that
#     actually corrupts the KIS link, so it is unconditionally fatal.
#     RIG_BYPASS=1 still overrides it, for genuine manual recovery.
#   * If you are an IDENTIFIED agent (RIG_AGENT set) driving without a live
#     lease of your own, REFUSE under enforcement (the default). This is what
#     makes acquire-first mandatory and keeps `status` trustworthy.
#   * If RIG_AGENT is UNSET (a human running by hand), stay lenient: WARN and
#     proceed on an idle rig. A manual run is never blocked by enforcement;
#     only the collision case above stops it.
#
# Enforcement is ON by default (RIG_ENFORCE defaults to 1). Set RIG_ENFORCE=0
# to relax the acquire-first nudges back to warnings.
#
# Contract (set BEFORE `source`-ing this):
#   RIG_AGENT              who you are ("claude", "sol"); unset = manual/human.
#   RIG_ENFORCE=0          relax: acquire-first nudges warn instead of refusing.
#   RIG_ALLOW_RECOVERY=1   set by the recovery-boot script; lets it run while
#                          NEEDS_RECOVERY is set (fixing the link is its job).
#   RIG_BYPASS=1           escape hatch; skips the check entirely (loud).

# t6040 Linux bring-up — NEXT STEPS

Handoff state (2026-07-13): mainline Linux boots to a BusyBox shell on the
M4 Pro with working internal keyboard, watchdog, and a **fully remote dev
loop** — two-way m1n1 proxy AND Linux shell (`/dev/ttydc0`) over one DebugUSB
cable; reboot via `macvdmtool`. No screen-reading or physical access needed.
Operational details, recipes, and history: `DEVLOG.md`. Long-term: `roadmap.md`.
Read the DebugUSB link rules in DEVLOG before touching the rig.

## 1. Provision and test the J614s trackpad firmware
`event0` is Apple DockChannel Multi-touch and `event1` is the keyboard. The
transport's missing firmware loader and stuck-start error path are fixed and
live-tested in kernel build #12: repeated opens now independently request
`apple/tpmtfw-j614s.bin` and return `-ENOENT`, with no invalid resets or stale
`-EINPROGRESS`. Retrieve the paired HIDF blob from this target's Asahi ESP at
`vendorfw/apple/tpmtfw-j614s.bin`, or process its
`asahi/all_firmware.tar.gz` with `asahi-fwextract`, then rebuild with
`TRACKPAD_FIRMWARE=/path/to/tpmtfw-j614s.bin`, and retest motion. If MTP then
requests its reset GPIO, stop: the now-derived `gp1c` function resolves through
the ADT's `smc-pmu` node, and PMU writes are forbidden by the project rules.
No tactile click is expected yet (the haptic actuator is a separate interface).
Full finding:
`done/2026-07-12-t6040-trackpad-firmware.md`.

## 2. Review and upstream the proven T6041 PMGR quirk
The full 214-domain topology now boots to BusyBox **3/3** with the exact minimal
temporary policy: preserve firmware-active domains, disable only `disp_cpu`,
and skip auto-enable only on `dispext0_cpu` and `dispext1_cpu`. Both CPU skips
are individually necessary at bank granularity; the `sys`, `fe`, and five old
ANE exclusions are unnecessary. Legacy raw fails 3/3. Full matrix and hashes:
`done/2026-07-12-t6040-pmgr-matrix.md`.

The supported shape is now implemented and live-tested in build #14. The
two-patch draft starts with `patches/t6040-pmgr-t6041-bindings.patch`, then
`patches/t6040-pmgr-t6041-quirks.patch` selects preserve-active and the two CPU
auto-enable exceptions from `apple,t6041-pmgr-pwrstate`; Linux `37339d595765`
removes the experiment-only properties from the standard DT. The series passes
checkpatch and both binding schemas validate. No further policy bisection is
needed.

Next, in leverage order:
1. Ask flokli for the J773s PMGR policy (draft only here; maintainer sends).
2. If pre-userspace attribution becomes necessary, first add a bounded
   polled/atomic TX primitive to the DockChannel mailbox. Do not register the
   current `ttydc` kfifo/workqueue path as a printk console: it is not safe in
   atomic or panic context and can recurse through its own error printk.

Done this session: raw determinism, requested core-infra and PMGR1 isolations,
live ADT regeneration, `no_ps` parent filtering, and safe always-on generation
(no policy by default; explicit legacy flag only).

## 3. Restore DebugUSB, test the ANS PMGR hold, then resume NVMe
The maintainer approved the exact CoastGuard writes. The retry established two
separate boundaries:

1. A handshake-only SART probe still reset, while a zero-MMIO SART probe booted.
   `patches/t8140-sart-defer-scan.patch` now defers the protected-entry scan
   until the first client has the complete ANS power context. With that fix,
   both the SART-only DT and the full DT with `nvme-apple` unloaded reached
   BusyBox.
2. Loading `nvme-core.ko` succeeded. Loading `nvme-apple.ko` reset the target.
   Yielding phase checkpoints made the exact last successful point
   `before ANS CPU control read`; the fatal operation is the first read of
   `0x209600044`, before any CoastGuard write, SART entry access, or namespace
   command.

Read-only ADT-derived PMGR inspection found that firmware leaves `ANS` at
`0x0f0000ff`: target and actual state `0xf`, with AUTO_ENABLE clear. Linux's
T6041 PMGR probe otherwise enables automatic gating before the NVMe module's
first access. `patches/t6040-pmgr-ans-no-auto.patch` adds an NVMe-only build
exception, and `dts/t6040-j614s-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold.dts` independently selects
the same existing bring-up policy. Both compile; the hypothesis is not yet
live-verified. The last diagnostic reached BusyBox, but its log relay replayed
historical PMGR output and the m1n1 proxy then remained unresponsive after the
documented kisd/re-entry recovery. Stop live work until DebugUSB is healthy.

The recovery helper now makes the fresh kisd PTY raw and attaches its own
reader before DebugUSB traffic. A later recovery confirmed the complete m1n1
startup packet, but proxyclient then timed out while 3.2 KiB of historical
Linux output remained queued. The next reboot stopped after iBoot Stage2, and
then fell through to Apple's "macOS on the selected disk needs to be
reinstalled" screen instead of launching m1n1. The following DebugUSB VDM
failed; live work stopped with kisd detached. This proves only that Apple's
boot chain identified the selected system volume, not that Linux NVMe ran.

Run the recovery helper; it now requires a healthy `Running proxy` and three
unchanged console-size samples before returning. Then boot only the prepared
trace set and relay new `trace:` lines, not the historical PMGR backlog:

- `Image-sart-trace`:
  `0c4880522c4793629f6e9a25ea164c911801e67754ae43cd3a6b5b274e20e8e6`;
- `t6040-j614s-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold.dtb`:
  `cc2c48e30a09080117222d5f4c9fb795dfd6bb338d2cf26b23085ad947ffbefb`;
- `initramfs-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold.cpio.gz`:
  `ae80f82033e5f0d683ac09a3fa61e67c3c63e8a7c1be7593a0fd7fe687732873`.

Load `nvme-core.ko`, then `nvme-apple.ko`. If the trace passes the CPU-control
read, continue phase by phase. Enumerate read-only only after controller boot;
never mount, repair, format, flush, or write the namespace. Full evidence and
the eventual enumeration transcript are in
`done/2026-07-13-t6040-nvme-map.md`.

## 4. Upstream / share
- Post the drafted writeups: `done/2026-07-10-t6040-smp-writeup.md`,
  `done/2026-07-10-t6040-cpufreq-writeup.md` (#asahi-dev).
- Keep the curated code-only branch `t6040-bringup` (worktree
  `~/Code/m1n1-clean`) in sync with any new src/ changes on main.
- Report the dockchannel-uart dead-IRQ finding + poll-mode patch to the
  dockchannel-branch authors (yuka / Michael Reeves) — t8140 may differ.

## Parked (revisit after pmgr)
- USB gadget console → gadget-Ethernet + SSH (EP0 dies post-enumeration;
  `done/2026-07-11-t6040-usb-gadget-plan.md`).
- cpufreq throttle offsets (t6030 offsets SError on t6040 P-clusters; needs RE
  or #asahi-dev answer).
- ATC PHY tunables (USB3/TB) — blocked on t6040 PHY reg-bucket offsets;
  USB2-only fallback is fine for now.

# t6040 Linux bring-up — NEXT STEPS

Handoff state (2026-07-13): mainline Linux boots to a BusyBox shell on the
M4 Pro with working internal keyboard, watchdog, and a **fully remote dev
loop** — two-way m1n1 proxy AND Linux shell (`/dev/ttydc0`) over one DebugUSB
cable; reboot via `macvdmtool`. No screen-reading or physical access needed.
Operational details, recipes, and history: `DEVLOG.md`. Long-term: `roadmap.md`.
Read the DebugUSB link rules in DEVLOG before touching the rig.

## 0. Localize the T6040 PCIe asynchronous SError

The former register-map blocker is solved. Static analysis of the paired macOS
kernelcache proves the two new T6040 groups target ADT reg[5] (CIO3 PLL at
`0x415046200`) and reg[6] (PCIe clkgen at `0x415044000`). m1n1 main
`eb23c423` / curated `da1791a0` apply them and then run the reused T6031/T8122
sequence. The separate `t6040-j614s-dcuart-pcie` kernel DT builds cleanly and
describes BCM4388 WiFi/BT on port 0 plus the GL9755 SD reader on port 1.

Six approved diagnostics ran on 2026-07-14. The first completed all 77
AXI tunables and stopped after `pcie: No common tunables`. The traced retry on
main `81da3522` delivered the real failure earlier: AXI tunable `[70]`, manifest
operation 90 in that build, printed `done`; before `[71]` was announced, m1n1
took an asynchronous SError (`L2C_ERR_STS=0x82`) in the proxy `P_CALL`
trampoline and rebooted. Because the fault is asynchronous, `[70]` is only the
delivery boundary, not proof of the causal write. The sanctioned DebugUSB
recovery restored a stable proxy. Linux never handed off, no PHY/port/PERST
operation ran, and no storage was accessed. Exact trace:
`logs/t6040-console-20260714-pcie-axi-trace.log` (SHA-256
`41774ef8866e775de30ca2c98957d167085943163fe24d25c7aaca29eb177860`).

Offline disassembly then exposed a real ordering difference. J614s has eight
PCIe `clock-gates`; `ApplePCIEBaseT8132::_enableRootComplex()` enables gates
0–6, applies AXI then CIO3 and clkgen tunables, and only afterward enables gate
7 (`APCIE_PHY_SW`). m1n1 previously enabled all eight before AXI. Main
`6efe2d45` and curated `954fd4cf` reproduce Apple's staging and retain the
diagnostic return before the first PHY register access.

The separately approved staged run used main binary SHA-256
`c2a5b7e27bb8d56479f46d6b485a195d2eb1cd64a3b86fbe3c90db1f00424735`
and the exact 105-operation subset in
`done/2026-07-14-t6040-pcie-clock-diagnostic.tsv` (SHA-256
`ce86e51aa3d278da1d9ef9eb35fca3208859f4993480de5b6af3268dc03ef4e6`).
It produced the same result: AXI `[70]` at `0x4160013fc` printed `done`, then an
asynchronous SError arrived before `[71]`, with `L2C_ERR_STS=0x82`. It never
reached CIO3, clkgen, the late gate, PHY, ports, Linux, or storage. Therefore
early `APCIE_PHY_SW` enable was not the cause. Exact transcript:

`c31275546280b9df2dbf9b014d2e6411cfb708f87f1c803e10b11e2cdb95ec2f`).
DebugUSB recovery restored a fresh, quiescent proxy.

The no-new-address follow-up ran at m1n1 main `88ce1ee3`
(`v1.6.0-68-g88ce1ee3`), binary SHA-256
`2997b07647007f99df6ad094a2da55d66a9f7accd6758bb134d3fa92b76d0c72`.
It placed `dsb sy` and a read-only `L2C_ERR_STS` sample before the first and
after every existing traced RMW, aborting on a nonzero result without clearing
status. AXI `[70]` again printed `done`, proving its barrier completed and its
status sample was zero; the same SError then arrived before `[71]`. Thus the
status becomes visible only with the delayed exception and cannot attribute an
individual write this way. Transcript:
`logs/t6040-console-20260714-pcie-barrier.log` (SHA-256
`cebc058921b62b2f594855bb65db28b312570b6c707f5a29a29480c31c04667b`).
Recovery restored a fresh quiescent proxy. Full result:
`done/2026-07-14-t6040-pcie-barrier-diagnostic.md`.

The zero-PCIe-write trace-volume control ran at main `3e772779`
(`v1.6.0-72-g3e772779`), binary SHA-256
`c9296b8d1ca146a32c7a1ba1bf17b7091281588ab90d16a69f0718c5a8fa04ea`.
It enumerates the same ADT AXI entries and prints the identical 77 pre/`done`
pairs, but returns before enabling any PCIe clock or reading/writing controller
MMIO. It nevertheless produced the same SError after `[70] done`. This proves
that the traced SError is entirely a console/log artifact, not a PCIe access.
Transcript: `logs/t6040-console-20260714-pcie-trace-dry-run.log`, SHA-256
`52431e2a9a7d87642fde917419f3e8e666672434953cad23466c13b61968742d`.

The exact mechanism was bounded offline. The 16 KiB m1n1 log buffer was
`0x105ce7a4000..0x105ce7a8000`, ending exactly at the top of normal RAM; every
SError reports that exclusive end in `L2C_ERR_ADR`. When the log device becomes
writable, `iodev_console_write()` first flushes its retained 8 KiB console
backlog. The identical post-allocation stream contributes another 9,274 bytes:
the ring crosses its end during `[61] done`, then the asynchronous error is
delivered 1,082 bytes later after `[70] done`. The zero-PCIe-write upper-guard
control ran at main `a61fd099` (`v1.6.0-75-ga61fd099`), binary SHA-256
`1394c34504345fff1403340070029a5feedf744b032af02cd22c936026a7e61b`.
It keeps the active 16 KiB ring one unused 16 KiB page below top-of-RAM and
repeated the identical dry-run trace. All 77 entries and the completion marker
printed without SError, and the base kernel reached its BusyBox shell. This
live-proves the upper guard and fully exonerates the PCIe sequence from the
traced `[70]` failure. Exact m1n1 transcript:
`logs/t6040-console-20260714-logbuf-upper-guard.log` (SHA-256
`2e8624d795bc6bddab24b932a530bf7f992f35732402ed041bfc308857260d63`).
Full result: `done/2026-07-14-t6040-logbuf-upper-guard-control.md`.

Next, restore the Apple-ordered 105-operation write path while retaining the
proven upper guard, per-RMW barriers/status samples, and stop-before-PHY return.
Prepare and hash that binary; its live run requires fresh explicit approval.
Continue using the PCIe-free base DT; do not access NVMe or
mount/repair/format storage.

## 1. Provision and test the J614s trackpad firmware
`event0` is Apple DockChannel Multi-touch and `event1` is the keyboard. The
transport's missing firmware loader and stuck-start error path are fixed and
live-tested in kernel build #12: repeated opens now independently request
`apple/tpmtfw-j614s.bin` and return `-ENOENT`, with no invalid resets or stale
`-EINPROGRESS`. Retrieve the paired HIDF blob from this target's Asahi ESP at
`vendorfw/apple/tpmtfw-j614s.bin`, or process its
`asahi/all_firmware.tar.gz` with `asahi-fwextract`, then rebuild with
`TRACKPAD_FIRMWARE=/path/to/tpmtfw-j614s.bin`, and retest motion. If MTP then
requests its reset GPIO, stop: the now-derived `gp1c` function resolves through
the ADT's `smc-pmu` node, and PMU writes are forbidden by the project rules.
No tactile click is expected yet (the haptic actuator is a separate interface).
Full finding:
`done/2026-07-12-t6040-trackpad-firmware.md`.

## 2. Review and upstream the proven T6041 PMGR quirk
The full 214-domain topology now boots to BusyBox **3/3** with the exact minimal
temporary policy: preserve firmware-active domains, disable only `disp_cpu`,
and skip auto-enable only on `dispext0_cpu` and `dispext1_cpu`. Both CPU skips
are individually necessary at bank granularity; the `sys`, `fe`, and five old
ANE exclusions are unnecessary. Legacy raw fails 3/3. Full matrix and hashes:
`done/2026-07-12-t6040-pmgr-matrix.md`.

The supported shape is now implemented and live-tested in build #14. The
two-patch draft starts with `patches/t6040-pmgr-t6041-bindings.patch`, then
`patches/t6040-pmgr-t6041-quirks.patch` selects preserve-active and the two CPU
auto-enable exceptions from `apple,t6041-pmgr-pwrstate`; Linux `37339d595765`
removes the experiment-only properties from the standard DT. The series passes
checkpatch and both binding schemas validate. No further policy bisection is
needed.

Next, in leverage order:
1. Ask flokli for the J773s PMGR policy (draft only here; maintainer sends).
2. If pre-userspace attribution becomes necessary, first add a bounded
   polled/atomic TX primitive to the DockChannel mailbox. Do not register the
   current `ttydc` kfifo/workqueue path as a printk console: it is not safe in
   atomic or panic context and can recurse through its own error printk.

Done this session: raw determinism, requested core-infra and PMGR1 isolations,
live ADT regeneration, `no_ps` parent filtering, and safe always-on generation
(no policy by default; explicit legacy flag only).

## 3. Solve protected T8140 NVMe queue ownership

The power and coprocessor side is now proven. Linux forces the three gated PCIe
parents actual-on, activates the CoastGuard SART, allocates RTKit buffers,
boots ANS, and reads `APPLE_ANS_BOOT_STATUS_OK`. The remaining failure is not a
DT, PMGR, SART, or RTKit problem.

T8140 protects both the legacy linear-queue/NVMMU setup and the standard NVMe
queue registers. Main-BAR reads/writes at `MAX_PEND`/AQA fault; the secure BAR
at CPU PA `0x44dcc0000` is readable and contains iBoot's disabled-controller
admin queue state. Static analysis of the paired macOS kernel and
IONVMeFamily resolved the real interface: Apple calls `_pmap_iommu_ioctl`,
whose NVMe backend enters SPTM with service 6 operations 0–8 for controller
initialization, TCB authorization, admin/I/O queue registration, and queue
activation.

The exact service-6 operation 0 + operation 4 sequence was implemented in
`patches/t6040-nvme-sptm-debug.patch` and tried once. Raw m1n1 reports
`SPRR_CONFIG_EL1=0` and `GXF_CONFIG_EL1=0`; Linux reached
`before protected admin queue setup`, then hung at Apple GENTER
(`.inst 0x00201420`). No SPTM call returned. The watchdog recovered to m1n1.
Do not repeat that call unchanged, and do not resume direct main- or secure-BAR
writes.

The preservation question now has a structural answer: iBoot's secure ASQ/ACQ
buffers (`0x101005db000` / `0x101005dc000`) live in ordinary RAM that m1n1 does
not reserve, and the macOS path performs service-6 TCB authorization for each
command. Preserving only those queues cannot provide a complete Linux NVMe
path. Keep further work static: determine whether raw boot can acquire the
required protected execution state through a documented loader transition or
whether storage must wait for upstream M4 SPTM support. No Identify command has
run; never mount, repair, format, flush, or write the namespace.

Exact current transcript: `logs/t6040-console-20260714-nvme-sptm.log`.
Full cumulative analysis: `done/2026-07-13-t6040-nvme-map.md`.

## Storage investigation history (superseded by #3 above)
The maintainer approved the exact CoastGuard writes. The retry established two
separate boundaries:

1. A handshake-only SART probe still reset, while a zero-MMIO SART probe booted.
   `patches/t8140-sart-defer-scan.patch` now defers the protected-entry scan
   until the first client has the complete ANS power context. With that fix,
   both the SART-only DT and the full DT with `nvme-apple` unloaded reached
   BusyBox.
2. Loading `nvme-core.ko` succeeded. Loading `nvme-apple.ko` reset the target.
   Yielding phase checkpoints made the exact last successful point
   `before ANS CPU control read`; the fatal operation is the first read of
   `0x209600044`, before any CoastGuard write, SART entry access, or namespace
   command.

Read-only ADT-derived PMGR inspection found that firmware leaves `ANS` at
`0x0f0000ff`: target and actual state `0xf`, with AUTO_ENABLE clear. Linux's
T6041 PMGR probe otherwise enables automatic gating before the NVMe module's
first access. `patches/t6040-pmgr-ans-no-auto.patch` adds an NVMe-only build
exception, and `dts/t6040-j614s-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold.dts` independently selects
the same existing bring-up policy. Both compile; the hypothesis is not yet
live-verified. The last diagnostic reached BusyBox, but its log relay replayed
historical PMGR output and the m1n1 proxy then remained unresponsive after the
documented kisd/re-entry recovery. Stop live work until DebugUSB is healthy.

The recovery helper now makes the fresh kisd PTY raw and attaches its own
reader before DebugUSB traffic. A later recovery confirmed the complete m1n1
startup packet, but proxyclient then timed out while 3.2 KiB of historical
Linux output remained queued. The next reboot stopped after iBoot Stage2, and
then fell through to Apple's "macOS on the selected disk needs to be
reinstalled" screen instead of launching m1n1. The following DebugUSB VDM
failed; live work stopped with kisd detached. This proves only that Apple's
boot chain identified the selected system volume, not that Linux NVMe ran.

Run the recovery helper; it now requires a healthy `Running proxy` and three
unchanged console-size samples before returning. Then boot only the prepared
trace set and relay new `trace:` lines, not the historical PMGR backlog:

- `Image-sart-trace`:
  `0c4880522c4793629f6e9a25ea164c911801e67754ae43cd3a6b5b274e20e8e6`;
- `t6040-j614s-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold.dtb`:
  `cc2c48e30a09080117222d5f4c9fb795dfd6bb338d2cf26b23085ad947ffbefb`;
- `initramfs-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold.cpio.gz`:
  `ae80f82033e5f0d683ac09a3fa61e67c3c63e8a7c1be7593a0fd7fe687732873`.

The exact set was finally booted as Linux #24. `nvme-core.ko` returned zero;
`nvme-apple.ko` watchdog-reset the target. That boot did not have a kmsg relay,
so the absence of trace messages on ttydc does **not** move the fatal boundary
earlier than the prior `before ANS CPU control read` result. For the next
single retry, use the newly built trace-relay initramfs below and add
`EXTRA_BOOTARGS=t6040.trace_relay=1`; it relays only current-boot `trace:` lines
before the shell command is run.

- `initramfs-dcuart-nvme-ans-hold-trace.cpio.gz`:
  `8942b1bd009cd9fe0adeadea3de60d6f068120ae2b8327e0ae1df2c852f40ea5`.

Use the same Image and DTB hashes above. For agent-driven helpers, set
`T6040_KEEPALIVE=1` so kisd and the tty reader survive the automation shell.

That corrected retry is now complete. Its current-boot trace was identical to
the original through `reset work entered`, then stopped at
`before ANS CPU control read`. Therefore preserving ANS firmware state and
skipping AUTO_ENABLE did **not** move the boundary; the ANS auto-gating
hypothesis is disproven. Do not repeat this NVMe module load unchanged.

Next, boot the same trace-relay set but do not load either NVMe module. Capture
the software genpd state first (DEBUG_FS is enabled):

```sh
mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug
cat /sys/kernel/debug/pm_genpd/pm_genpd_summary \
  | grep -E 'ans|apcie|fab3'
for d in ans apcie_sys_st0 apcie_sys_st1 apcie_phy_sw; do
    echo "--- $d"
    cat "/sys/kernel/debug/pm_genpd/$d/current_state"
done
```

This is read-only software-state attribution. Use it to decide whether a
separately reviewed raw PMGR-state trace is warranted; do not perform another
ANS MMIO read merely to reproduce the same SError.

Captured: the summary and per-domain files report `on` for `ans`,
`apcie_sys_st0`, `apcie_sys_st1`, and `apcie_phy_sw`; the filtered summary also
shows `fab3_soc`, `apcie_st0`, `apcie_st1`, and `apcie_gp` on. Linux therefore
does not believe the storage power chain is off.

The bounded raw-state diagnostic is now built and host-verified.
`patches/t6040-nvme-pmgr-snapshot-debug.patch` is selected only by the boolean
`apple,pmgr-snapshot-stop` in
`dts/t6040-j614s-dcuart-nvme-pmgr-snapshot.dts`. After normal allocation has
attached the declared genpd chain, it follows only those existing DT
`power-domains` phandles, reads each provider's declared scalar `reg` through
its parent PMGR syscon, and returns before `nvme_add_ctrl()`. Reset work cannot
queue, so no ANS, CoastGuard, SART-entry, mailbox, NVMe register, or storage
command is reached. Its diagnostic exit intentionally retains the genpd links
until reboot instead of requesting a cleanup power transition. Do not unload
the diagnostic module; reboot after collecting the trace.

Prepared artifacts:

- `Image-nvme-pmgr-snapshot`:
  `1a056fd855f2d56508e90dc5b9a789d8dc6dcaaf8f7b2284b759756213056541`;

The single snapshot attempt is complete. Linux #25 reached BusyBox,
`nvme-core.ko` returned zero, and the diagnostic Apple module printed its full
snapshot plus `stopping before ANS MMIO`. The shell then answered two liveness
markers. The four storage values exactly match the earlier m1n1 snapshot:

```text
ans            raw 0x0f0000ff  target f  actual f  auto 0
apcie_phy_sw   raw 0x1400024f  target f  actual 4  auto 1
apcie_sys_st0  raw 0x1000030f  target f  actual 0  auto 1
apcie_sys_st1  raw 0x1000030f  target f  actual 0  auto 1
```

The genpd summary's `on` result was logically correct but incomplete:
`apple_pmgr_ps_is_active()` treats target-active plus AUTO_ENABLE as on even
when the actual state is clock-gated (`4`) or power-gated (`0`). Thus ANS itself
is fully active, while NVMe's other direct domain, `apcie_phy_sw`, is
clock-gated and both of that domain's `apcie_sys_st*` parents are power-gated
immediately before the fatal read.
This is the first evidence-backed new hypothesis since ANS auto-gating was
disproved.

The second diagnostic is now built and host-verified. The runtime-PM put/get
idea cannot work here because the T6041 preservation quirk marks every
firmware-active domain `GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON`; genpd therefore neither powers
the logical domain off nor re-enters its power-on callback.

`patches/t6040-pmgr-force-active-debug.patch` instead exports a diagnostic-only
helper from the existing PMGR driver. Under the provider's existing IRQ-safe
lock, it reads ACTUAL, skips providers already at `f`, and otherwise calls the
normal `apple_pmgr_ps_set(..., ACTIVE, false)` sequence. This clears automatic
gating, writes the existing PMGR state register, and polls ACTUAL. The Apple
diagnostic recursively follows only its declared DT parents, parents first,
then snapshots before/after and returns before `nvme_add_ctrl()`. On the known
snapshot it will write only `apcie_sys_st0`, `apcie_sys_st1`, and
`apcie_phy_sw`. It cannot queue reset work or access ANS MMIO. As before, do
not unload it; reboot after the trace.

The single force-active attempt is complete. Linux #26 reached BusyBox and all
three expected callbacks succeeded. The verified changes were:

```text
apcie_phy_sw   0x1400024f -> 0x0f0002ff  actual 4 -> f  auto 1 -> 0
apcie_sys_st0  0x1000030f -> 0x0f0003ff  actual 0 -> f  auto 1 -> 0
apcie_sys_st1  0x1000030f -> 0x0f0003ff  actual 0 -> f  auto 1 -> 0
```

ANS and every already-active provider remained unchanged. The diagnostic
printed `PMGR force-active verified; stopping before ANS MMIO`, and the shell
answered both liveness markers. The target was then rebooted rather than
unloading the module and returned to a quiescent m1n1 proxy.

This is the first successful physical-state correction at the fatal boundary.
The third diagnostic is now built. After the same before/after verification,
`patches/t6040-nvme-ans-read-debug.patch` performs exactly one `readl()` of
ANS CPU_CONTROL `0x209600044`, logs its returned value, and immediately exits
through the no-detach path. It does not queue reset work or write CPU_CONTROL.
The DT contains only `apple,pmgr-force-active-read-stop`; neither earlier stop
property is present. Strict checkpatch, full kernel/module link, patch reversal,
DT inspection, marker inspection, and initramfs module comparison all pass.

Run this once with the current-boot relay. A successful read justifies a later
force-active controller-boot attempt; another reset disproves the
parent-gating hypothesis. Never mount, repair, format, flush, or write the
namespace. Prior exact output:
